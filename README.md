# Smart-Glass
Smart glasses or Digital Eye Glass or Personal Imaging System are a wearable computer that adds information to what the wearer sees.  Typically this is achieved through an optical head-mounted display (OHMD) or computerized internet-connected glasses with transparent heads-up display (HUD) or augmented reality (AR) overlay that has the capability of reflecting projected digital images as well as allowing the user to see through it, or see better with it.
